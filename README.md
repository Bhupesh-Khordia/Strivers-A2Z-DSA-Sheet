# 🚀 Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet — C++ Solutions

Hey there! I'm **Bhupesh Yadav**, and this repo captures my journey tackling \~450 Data Structures & Algorithms problems from Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet in C++.

---

## 💡 What’s Inside

* Clean, well-structured C++ solutions to \~450 problems across all core DSA topics.
* Follows Striver’s curriculum—starting from **Arrays** & **Math** basics, up to **Graphs**, **DP**, **Tries**, and beyond.
* Each solution includes:

  * **Problem statement**
  * **Link of question on popular platforms**
  * **C++ implementation**
  <!-- * **Time & space complexity** analysis -->

Striver’s A2Z Sheet is a **free, comprehensive, and structured guide** for mastering DSA, ideal for interview prep, and widely used by devs worldwide.

## 📚 Topic-wise Breakdown

Organized by folders like:

```
01.Basics/
02.Sorting/
03.Arrays/
04.Binary Search/
05.Strings/
06.Linked List/
07.Recursion/
08.Bit Manipulation/
09.Stack & Queue/
10.Sliding Window/
11.Heaps/
12.Greedy/
13.Binary Trees/
14.BST/
15.Graphs/
16.Dynamic Programming/
17.Tries/
18.Advanced Strings/
```

Inside each folder: subfolders (easy/medium/hard) or files with:

```cpp
// Problem: [title] – [platform/res/ID]
// Approach: [brief overview]
// Code: [filename.cpp]
// Complexity: Time O(...), Space O(...)
```
